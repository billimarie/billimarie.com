<h2 id="writer-earthworker-and-programmer">Writer, Earthworker, and Programmer</h2>

<p>Billimarie’s work consists of exploring the intersection of nature, technology, and storytelling.</p>

<p>Her journey began with a typewriter and a desire to connect with strangers through giving away spontaneous Free Poetry.</p>

<p>Today, that desire has taken root in the Mojave Desert, where she founded a regenerative agriculture nonprofit to help grow nutritional food, healthy soil, and community resilience.</p>

<p>Billimarie creates story-driven experiences that help people, especially future generations, thrive in alignment with nature, intuition, heart, and spirit. As a community organizer, she is passionate about reimagining how people can work together to restore ecosystems across Earth.</p>

<p>Her work bridges a variety of mediums, including poetry, film, essays, fiction, painting, photography, and immersive outdoor experiences.</p>
